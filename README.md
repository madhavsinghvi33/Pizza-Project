# Pizza-Project
## This is the first Project that I created when I initially learnt Python. It is a simple code that asks you about your personal details and allows you to make your own pizza. It consists of simple operations and functions like form, loop, tkinter, define, import, button etc. 

## After learning the basics of python, I wanted to implement all the various techniques and functions in a single code. Craving pizza one night, I loaded the online Domino's Pizza website. However, the navigation system was extremely hard and challenging. It was hard to order the food and use the online payment method. This prompted me to build a scaled-down version of a Pizza website, where customers can include their personal information and place their orders. A picture has been uploaded to this repository showing how the form looks. (File Name: PizzaProject.png)

## This code stems from my main ideology revolving around coding. Keep it simple. I want to resolve complex problems in a manner that makes it easy to understand and comprehend, even for the layman.
